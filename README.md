# Baby Tracking App

This baby tracking app is a web-based application that helps parents track and monitor their baby's growth and development. The app allows users to log and manage information about diaper changes, sleep patterns, feeding, milestones, and growth data.

The application was written for my newborn baby Olivia, and the idea was inspired by Roscxn (https://github.com/roscxn/).

## Features

- User authentication: Sign up and log in functionality.
- Dashboard: Overview of the baby's latest activities and growth data.
